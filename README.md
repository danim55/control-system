# control-system
Arduino-based climate control system using DHT22 and LDR to monitor temperature, humidity, and light. A servo simulates heating/cooling, and LEDs adjust lighting levels. Data is shown on a 20Ã—4 LCD. Uses simple ON-OFF logic with lux conversion. Built in C++ and simulated in Wokwi.
